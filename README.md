The mission for this project is to create a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions
and the ability to store and view high scores. The time limit begins at 60 seconds. If a question
is answered correctly, 15 seconds are added onto the timer. If a question is answered incorrectly,
10 seconds is taken off of the timer.

This project's acceptance criteria reads below:

=======================================================
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
=========================================================

This project was to further familiarize myself with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML
and to become more familiar with tests such as this I will asked to complete
as I proceed on my journey to becoming a full-stack web developer.



This code was written on VSCode and pushed from terminal.

After completing the the criteria I added a little pizazz to make it look more fun using CSS.
